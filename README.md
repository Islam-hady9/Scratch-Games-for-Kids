The best way for a young programmer to develop their coding skills is through the Scratch community and visual interface. However, it can be difficult to know where to begin and what to build. The limitless number of projects that you can code on Scratch can be daunting. Here are some of the best Scratch games to design and create for all levels of scratch users.

## [Game 1. Chase Game](https://github.com/Islam-hady9/Scratch-Games-for-Kids/blob/main/Game%201.%20Chase%20Game.sb3)

Perhaps the best place to start discovering the world of Scratch is by using their curated list of tutorials. Building this Chase Game teaches students how to select their sprites (characters) and backdrops. Students then learn how to control their characters by pressing arrow keys. Finally, the tutorial teaches students how to use conditional statements (if-then blocks) to get their characters to interact with each other.

## [Game 2. Code Your Own Adventure](https://github.com/Islam-hady9/Scratch-Games-for-Kids/blob/main/Game%202.%20Code%20Your%20Own%20Adventure.sb3)

This Scratch tutorial shows students how to create their own adventure game. This collaboration with Cartoon Network uses popular television characters as the main sprites. Students will begin to familiarize themselves with loops and gliding blocks to continuously move their characters using their mouse-pointers. Then, students will be introduced to the concept of variables to keep track of how many times their character captures an item. This tutorial is a great way to unlock your student’s creativity and interest in coding.

## [Game 3. Catching Game](https://github.com/Islam-hady9/Scratch-Games-for-Kids/blob/main/Game%203.%20Catching%20Game.sb3)

The Scratch team makes informative and easy-to-follow YouTube video tutorials. This particular video tutorial teaches students how to create a game where objects fall from the sky and the player’s character tries to collect as many as possible. If your student has never learned about graph coordinates, then this is an excellent way to present the concept in a clear and simple manner.

## [Game 4. Pong Game](https://github.com/Islam-hady9/Scratch-Games-for-Kids/blob/main/Game%204.%20Pong%20Game.sb3)

Few video games can claim to be as longstanding and revolutionary as Pong. The Atari table tennis video game was invented in 1972 and quickly ushered in the era of home video game systems. The Scratch version of this classic game utilizes many important coding blocks including if-then statements to make the paddle and ball interact and variables to keep track of how many bounces off the paddle the player achieves.

## [Game 5. Flappy Bird Scratch Game](https://github.com/Islam-hady9/Scratch-Games-for-Kids/blob/main/Game%205.%20Flappy%20Bird%20Scratch%20Game.sb3)

In early 2014, the mobile game Flappy Bird took the world by storm. Part of the game’s appeal was its basic mechanics and high level of difficulty. In the game, a player controls a falling bird to flap its wings and fly upwards as you attempt to maneuver yourself between oncoming obstacles. Create & Learn has made an online tutorial on how to build your own version of Flappy Bird. One of the most important concepts covered in this tutorial is how to use if-then-else statements to get your bird to fly upwards whenever the space key is pressed. This project is also taught in our fun, live online Scratch Ninja series of classes designed by experts from MIT, Stanford, and Google.
